# Employee Attrition Prediction System

Employee attrition happens when an employee leaves an organization for any reason and is not replaced for a long time
This is a machine learning project where I built a simple web app to predict whether an employee is likely to leave their job, based on various input features. The project was created to learn and apply concepts like preprocessing, model training, and deploying a model using Flask.

# Dataset
This project uses the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset from Kaggle.

Rows: 1,470 employees
Columns: 35 features (both categorical and numerical)
Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

---

# Feature Selection
To keep the model simple and lightweight for the web app, I selected 7 high-importance features:

Age
DistanceFromHome
YearsSinceLastPromotion
NumCompaniesWorked
OverTime (converted to OverTime_Yes)
BusinessTravel (converted to BusinessTravel_Travel_Frequently)
JobRole (focused on Laboratory Technician role)
